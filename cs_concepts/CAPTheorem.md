**What is CAP Theorem?**
- concept in database systems and maintenance
- stands for consistency, availability, partition tolerance

**Consistency**: each clients should have the same view of data  
**Availability**: every node that's up can be depended on to return a response (including read and write requests) in a reasonable time  
**Partition tolerance**: the ability of a system to function and continue its consistency gaurantees regardless of how the network is partitioned; partition tolerance is how graceful a system can recover from partitions (network partitions are inevitable)
